# nn-from-scratch

Welcome to the nn-from-scratch repository! 

This project is an exploration into the world of neural networks implemented entirely from scratch, without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The focus is on building a simple neural network capable of mapping an image to its flip, using a shallow architecture with a single hidden layer containing one neuron.
